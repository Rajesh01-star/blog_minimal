Doesn’t replace the second bracket’s with the URL, but it feels like a stretch of Markdown’s syntax capabilities.

### What I’m trying to do

I’m trying to figure out a quick/easy way to create notes with visual references, stored as image files, locally or remotely.  
I need to be able to preview the full size of, and choose to open the full image file.[^1]

I’m using Firefox as a web browser, if that helps anyhow (perhaps there’s an addon that I missed, capable of making a link equivalent to [second syntax](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/link-to-and-embed-an-image/20863#markdown-header-recursive-md-link)).

[^1]: On that note, something to automatically grab and save linked remote images/files to a folder would be nice as well. It could be solved with [this feature request 105](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/transclude-embed-external-files-present-on-the-computer/16389): I’ll peek into the post #25 when it comes to finding a suitable workaround for the time being.
